# About  

**Trackerforce Services** is a Spring multi-module project that supports the core functionalities available through the Trackerforce Management, which includes:
- Identity Management
- Business Configuration
- Session Executor

## Architecture overview

Trackerforce Services was built to integrate main core services into a distributed ecosystem. Although core services are maintained under the same multi-module project, they are deployed independently, meaning that changes can trigger one or more module CI pipeline.

Two categories of Services were created, Global (Identity) and Multi-tenant (Management and Session).

As for the core libraries, the two common libraries follows the dependency structure below for the Multi-tenant Services:
> Service Module -> Common Multi-tenancy Library -> Common Library

For the Global Service:
> Service Module -> Common Library
